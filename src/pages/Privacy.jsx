      <p>
        Chatify automatically compresses images at the time of upload, so you
        don’t need to worry about size limits or error messages like “20MB is
        the size limit”. With Chatify, you can upload high-quality images in
        bulk and reduce their size without compromising quality. The app also
        offers support for various image formats like JPEG, PNG, and more. It
        also supports advanced settings like custom compression levels.
